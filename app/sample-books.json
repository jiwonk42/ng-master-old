    "description": "AngularJS is the leading framework for building dynamic JavaScript applications that take advantage of the capabilities of modern browsers and devices. AngularJS, which is maintained by Google, brings the power of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to the client, providing the foundation for complex and rich web apps. It allows you to build applications that are smaller, faster, and with a lighter resource footprint than ever before. Best-selling author Adam Freeman explains how to get the most from AngularJS. He begins by describing the MVC pattern and the many benefits that can be gained from separating your logic and presentation code. He then shows how you can use AngularJS's features within in your projects to produce professional-quality results.",
